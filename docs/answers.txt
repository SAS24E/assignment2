4. Branches are useful because teams can work on different features at the same time. This allows users to develop in isolated environments and not interfer with eachother too much(obviosuly still merge conflicts but they can be mitigated)

5. git status shows current state of the working directory while git log shows the repositorys commit history. 

6. command: git log -- Vehicle.h

7. command: git log --grep="file"

9. The main difference between their workflow is that the lieutenant's merge multiple developers code into their repositorys while the dictators only need to merge from the lieutenant repostories (which are typically more experienced programmers).

10. Essentially a larger team benefits because this results in cleaner code due to being managed/merged more often and it also results in less work for any single person.
